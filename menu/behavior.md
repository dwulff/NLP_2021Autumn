### Imaging data
- [CMU fMRI dataset](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs/project/theo-73/www/science2008/data.html): 60 concrete concepts. in 12 categories, collected while nine English speakers were presented with 60 line drawings of objects with text labels and were instructed to think of the same properties of the stimulus object consistently during each presentation. For each concept there are 6 instances of ~20k neural activity features (brain blood oxygenation levels). 
- [Trento EEG data-set for 60 concepts](http://clic.cimec.unitn.it/brian/compNeuroWSnaacl10/): concepts in 2 categories (work tools and land mammals), collected while seven Italian speakers were silently naming photographic images that represent these concepts. For each concept there are 6 instances of ~15k neural activity features (spectral power in voltage signals). 
- [ERP megastudy](https://osf.io/72b89/): Collection of ERP responses to 1,000 English words.

### Citizen-science studies and crowd-source platforms
